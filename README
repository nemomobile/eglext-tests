This project contains a number of EGL extension tests. These tests exercise
various functional aspects of each extension to verify a correct driver
implementation.

Compiling
---------

In order to compile the tests, EGL and OpenGL ES 2.0 libraries must be
installed in the system. Additionally, the following dependencies must be
installed:

    libx11-dev, libxext-dev, x11proto-composite-dev, libboost1.42-dev

Compile all available tests by typing:

    $ make

Running the tests
-----------------

When executed, each test produces output such as the following:

    Testing extension presence                     : OK
    Testing failure cases                          : OK
    Testing basic functionality                    : OK
    ...
    ================================================
    Result: OK

If any of the tests fail, the final line will contain "Result: FAIL" and the
executable will exit with a non-zero status.

Please refer to the doxygen comments in the test source code (test_*.cpp) for
detailed test descriptions.
